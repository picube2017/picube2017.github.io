<p>Here are some of the resources I found helpful for learning to develop Dynamics NAV web service based applications.</p>
<h4 id="C-AL-Programming"><a href="#C-AL-Programming" class="headerlink" title="C/AL Programming:"></a>C/AL Programming:</h4><p><a href="https://www.consultec.es/DocTutoriales/Introduction_to_CAL_Programming.pdf">Introduction to CAL Programming</a><br>This provides a good overview of the basics of CAL programming, which can become necessary in building a web service applications when a custom codeunit or page extension is required.</p>
<h4 id="Setting-up-Web-Services"><a href="#Setting-up-Web-Services" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Web Services:"></a>Setting up Web Services:</h4><p><a href="https://vjeko.com/blog/connecting-to-nav-through-web-services-recorded-session">Vjecko Web Service Recorded Session</a><br>Vjecko.com has a lot of detailed articles about web service programming, but this older post has a pdf and recorded session that shows how to expose and connect to web services from a .NET application.  Unfortunately, he shows how to create Web Service references in .NET using the now-deprecated Web Refrence method (from .NET 2) instead of the more current Service Reference method.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/freddyk/archive/2010/01/20/connecting-to-nav-web-services-from-c-using-service-reference-config-file-version.aspx">Using Service Reference to Connect to Web Services</a><br>This explains how to use Service Reference, using code instead of XML web.config configuration, which I found difficult to configure.  (Each time I updated the service reference, I would have to reconfigure the XML).</p>
<h4 id="NAV-Upgrade-Process"><a href="#NAV-Upgrade-Process" class="headerlink" title="NAV Upgrade Process:"></a>NAV Upgrade Process:</h4><p><a href="https://saurav-nav.blogspot.com/2012/12/nav-2013-upgrade-part-iv-sql-migration.html">Migration to SQL Server from C/SIDE Database</a><br>In order to use web services, you don’t need to be using the Role Tailored Client, but you must be using the a SQL server based NAV database.  Web Services can be configured and exposed using the Classic Client for SQL Server Databases.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/nav/archive/2012/03/05/rtc-debugging.aspx">Debugging Code Called by Web Services</a><br>C/AL code won’t necessarily execute the same as it did in the Classic Client when called  as a Web Service.  C/AL code called as web service execute in the NAV Server tier, instead of the client.  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff477107.aspx">Certain functions</a> aren’t available for code running in the NAV Server, and some design changes need to be made (for example, CONFIRM dialogue boxes don’t make sense in the context of a web service).  To debug the codeunits called through web services (or the Role Tailored Client), you will need to use Visual Studio.<br><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd338765.aspx#SU">More information.</a></p>
<h4 id="Deploying-a-NET-Application"><a href="#Deploying-a-NET-Application" class="headerlink" title="Deploying a .NET Application:"></a>Deploying a .NET Application:</h4><p><a href="https://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/deployment/visual-studio-web-deployment/deploying-to-iis">Deploying to IIS</a>  After you’ve built a .NET application that consumes .NET web services, you’ll have to find a way to deploy it on your servers, or Azure.  Connection strings can be used to specify different NAV servers for different environments (like development, QA, and prod).</p>
